# Employment Trend Analysis: The 2025 Government Sector Shift

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on translating raw employment data into a clear, high-impact narrative using Power BI. By applying data visualization best practices, I transformed a complex multi-series dataset into a focused "story" that highlights a critical anomaly in the Government sector while maintaining the context of the broader market.

## 📊 The Data Story
The primary visual utilizes a **Focus-Line Strategy** to guide the viewer's eye immediately to the most important insight.

### Design Choices
* **Selective Highlighting:** Used a muted grey palette for secondary industries (Mining, Hospitality, Trade) to provide "contextual noise" without distracting from the main story.
* **Emphasis:** Used a bold, red dashed line for the **Government** sector to signal an area requiring immediate attention.
* **Intentional Neutrality:** I intentionally avoided adding speculative annotations for the October 2025 dip. By presenting the "what" without assuming the "why," I maintain analytical integrity and provide a clean foundation for stakeholders to investigate further.

## 📈 Key Insights
* **Broad Market Stability:** From early 2024 through late 2025, most industries remained relatively flat, indicating a stable economic environment for the private sector.
* **The Government Anomaly:** The Government sector showed a significant downward trend starting in mid-2025, culminating in a sharp "V-shaped" drop in October.
* **Divergence:** This sector is the only one in the dataset to show this specific pattern of volatility, making it the primary focal point for this report.

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow
* **Tool:** Power BI
* **Visual Type:** Line Chart
* **Techniques:** * Series formatting for narrative focus.
    * Dynamic labeling to ensure clarity at a glance.
    * Data cleaning to align multiple industry timelines.

## 🚀 Conclusion
This report demonstrates that data storytelling isn't just about showing all the data—it's about highlighting the **right** data. By isolating the Government sector's unique behavior, this dashboard serves as a conversation starter for leadership to investigate specific policy or budget changes occurring in Q4 2025.
